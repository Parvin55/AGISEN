An innovative application offering irrigation management, plant health monitoring, and real-time plant visualization.


Problem Statement:
Creating a user-friendly mobile app-driven Smart Irrigation System, equipped with sensors and early disease detection, revolutionizes agriculture by enhancing water efficiency and safeguarding crops from threats.

Proposed System:

Smart Irrigation system:
This is a Smart irrigation system powered by IoT
In smart irrigation system it  monitors factors like soil moisture, temperature, and humidity with sensors to deliver the right amount of water to each plant. 
An ESP32 microcontroller acts as the brain, analyzing sensor data and controlling pumps based on pre-set schedules and real-time conditions. 
The system can be controlled and monitored remotely through a web app, allowing users to make informed decisions about irrigation schedules.

Plant Disease detection:
Emphasize the importance of proactive plantcare.
Uses image recognition technology for detecting disease.
Here we can upload the image of the leaf of the diseased plant.
It will say what is the type of disease and  whether it is healthy it is also mentioned. 
Gardeners can learn about plant health and take proactive measures to ensure plant flourishment.

Visual Monitoring:
ESP32 camera is used for analyzing the plant growth
The ESP32-CAM comes with an integrated camera module, which makes it easy to capture images and videos without requiring additional hardware.
It is equipped with Wi-Fi connectivity, allowing it to connect to your local network.
